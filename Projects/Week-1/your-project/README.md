## Project Description

Develop the game of roulette to allow a player to choose the number and determine whether or not he wins


## Rules

Roulette is a casino game where the player put a bet and pick a number / color or other variations in order to gain. 

Once the player has done his bets, a ball is launched and the roulette wheel is turned. The ball will land in a number (each number has one color). 

There are a few versions of the game (European, North American etc) but we are concentrating making the code work so we make this game very very simple.


## Workflow

1. the player places his total chips number and place his bet.

2. the player will be asked to put his bet amount and his bet number.

3. the casino will generate a random number

4. If the number the player choose is different from the generated number, the player loses his bet.
Otherwise he wins and he gains five times his bet. 

5. If he still has chips he can continue playing. If heâ€™s out of chips, the game stops and he loses.

## Organization

1. Use a trello to organize the project in time
2. Describe the projet with the 5W technique
3. Create a decision tree to illustrate all the stages of the process
